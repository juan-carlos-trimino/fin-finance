A Terraform reusable module for deploying microservices
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cert-manager is a powerful and extensible X.509 certificate management for Kubernetes. It will
obtain certificates from a variety of issuers; it ensures the certificates are valid and
up-to-date; and it will attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry. On the
other hand, Traefik is capable of handling certificates in your cluster, but only when there is a
single pod of Traefik running. This, of course, is not acceptable because this pod becomes a single
point of failure in the infrastructure. To solve this issue, youâ€™ll use cert-manager to request,
issue, renew, and store your certificates.

Define input variables to the module.
