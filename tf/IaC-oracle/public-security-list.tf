  # For vcn_id, use the OCID of the basic virtual network. To assign the OCID, before knowing it, assign an
  # output from the module, as input for the security list resource:
  # * Get the module's output attribute from the module's Outputs page.
  # * Assign a value to the resource argument with the expression:
  #   * <resource argument> = module.<module-name>.<output-attribute>
  #   * Example: vcn_id = module.vcn.vcn_id
  #   * Both the oci_core_security_list resource and the oracle-terraform-modules/vcn use the same argument
  #     name for virtual cloud network OCID: vcn_id.
  #   * The vcn_id on the left side of the equation is the argument (required input) for the resource.
  #   * The vcn_id on the right side of the equation is the OCID of the VCN that you create with the module.
  #   * It doesn't matter if you have run the VCN module script and created the VCN or not. Either way,
  #     Terraform assigns the VCN OCID to the security list after the VCN module is created.
