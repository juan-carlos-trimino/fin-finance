      (1) Authentication credentials should be sent only through encrypted connections (HTTPS). An
          exception to the encrypted connection may be the temporary passwords associated with
          email resets.
      (2) Remember that requested URLs are usually logged by the HTTP server (access_log), which
          include the query string. To prevent authentication credentials leakage to HTTP server
          logs, data should be sent to the server using the HTTP POST method.
      (3) The "remember me" functionality should be disabled.
      (4) After a successful login, the user should be informed about the last successful or
          unsuccessful access date/time so that he can detect and report suspicious activity.
      (5) When handling authentication errors, the application should not disclose which part of
          the authentication data was incorrect. Instead of "Invalid username" or "Invalid
          password", just use "Invalid username and/or password" interchangeably.
